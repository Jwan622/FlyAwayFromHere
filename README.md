### FlyAwayFromHere

# This app is a Turing School Personal project that incorporates the following functionality:
# Twitter Oauth
# Jquery/Javascript filtering
# Friendly forwarding
# Presenter classes for controller abstraction

### Dependencies
# factory girl
# Figaro
# Twitter Oauth
# Twitter Bootstrap
# Paperclip





### If you want to create more tests, some key points to remember:
-You can only search for trips that are categories in the database. So if you want to fly to Boston, you need to create a Category in the
 seed file or create a Category via the web app as admin.
-There are helpers in the support folder that allow you to reach real_trips_index page and the real_trip_info pages.
